I am a computer science researcher, passionate about bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and engineering problems. My expertise involves the development of decision-support methods, data-driven predictive modeling, asset management tools, and predictive maintenance solutions. I have contributed to multiple H2020 and NWO research projects. My research focus consists of the following concrete topics: data-driven decision-making, deep reinforcement learning, business process monitoring and optimization, and self-supervised learning. 

If you are interested in talking about my research or possible collaboration, I welcome you to email me at z(dot)bukhsh@tue(dot)nl.
