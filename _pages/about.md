My research group focus on developing tools and techniques to improve operational processes. The core research areas include business intelligence, business engineering and process engineering. My research focus consists of following concrete topics: data-driven decision-making, predictive maintenance, deep reinforcement learning, business process monitoring and optimisation and self-supervised and transfer learning.
